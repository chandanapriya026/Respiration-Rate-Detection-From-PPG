# Respiration-Rate-Detection-From-PPG

**Project Summary:**

Our project leverages cutting-edge technology to estimate respiratory rates (RR) from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs), we've achieved remarkable RR predictions with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.24, eliminating the need for manual adjustments. This innovation holds great potential for non-invasive health monitoring, intensive care, and remote patient care.
